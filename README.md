# Identify Customer Segments
**In this project, we will work with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution.** The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. **Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.** The job will be using unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then using those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, the assessment and cleaning the data is needed to convert the data into a usable form.

**The project is divided as follows:**
- Step 0: Load The data
- Step 1: Preprocessing
  -  Assessment - Cleaning - Re-encoding
  -  Feature engineering
- Step 2: Feature Transformation
  - Feature scaling and Perform the PCA
  - Interpret Principal Components
- Step 3: Clustering
  - Apply clustering
  - Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data
